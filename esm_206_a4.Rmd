INTRODUCTION

DATA AND METHODS


RESULTS



Results A: Visually explore changes in annual lobster abundance (counts) by site
```{r}
lobster_abundance <- read_csv("lobster_abundance_sbc_lter.csv",
                              na = "-99999") %>% 
  clean_names() 
  
```

```{r}
lobster_ysite <- lobster_abundance %>% 
  count(year, count, site
  ) %>% 
  mutate(tot_obs = count * n) %>% 
  select(year, site, tot_obs) %>% 
  group_by(site, year) %>%
  summarize(tot_obs_yr_site = sum(tot_obs))

```

```{r}
ggplot(lobster_ysite, aes(x = year, y = tot_obs_yr_site),
       show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_line(aes(color = site),
            show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_x_continuous(lim = c(2012, 2019), expand = c(0,0)) +
  scale_y_continuous(lim = c(0, 1000), expand = c(0,0)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Annual Lobster Abundance by Site",
       subtitle = "2012 - 2018",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Total Lobster Observations")  +
  geom_dl(aes(label = site, color = site), method = list("last.points"),
          )
```
 
```{r}
ggplot(lobster_ysite, aes(x = year)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = site)
                 ) +
  facet_wrap(~site) +
  theme_minimal()

```



Results B. Visually explore lobster size distribution shifts by comparing lobster sizes in 2012 and 2018.



Results C. Compare mean lobster sizes at MPA vs. non-MPA sites in 2012 and 2018.
