INTRODUCTION

DATA AND METHODS


RESULTS



Results A: Visually explore changes in annual lobster abundance (counts) by site
```{r}
lobster_abundance <- read_csv("lobster_abundance_sbc_lter.csv",
                              na = "-99999") %>% 
  clean_names() 
  
```

```{r}
lobster_ysite <- lobster_abundance %>% 
  count(year, count, site
  )

```

```{r}
ggplot(lobster_ysite, aes(x = year)) +
  geom_histogram()
```



Results B. Visually explore lobster size distribution shifts by comparing lobster sizes in 2012 and 2018.



Results C. Compare mean lobster sizes at MPA vs. non-MPA sites in 2012 and 2018.
