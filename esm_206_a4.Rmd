### INTRODUCTION

The California Spiny Lobster, *Panulirus interruptus*, is a decapod crustacean that has a habitat that spans from the Monterey Bay, California to Baja California, Mexico (Sea Grant California 2019). The California Spiny Lobster is one of the largest spiny lobsters in the world with males capable of growing up to three feet long and weighing up to 26 pounds. Fishing of California Spiny Lobster is regulated by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and has an open season from October through March (California Department of Fish and Wildlife and Sea Grant California 2019).

Data on California Spiny Lobsters has been collected off of the coast of Santa Barbara by the Santa Barbara Coastal Term Ecological Research (SBC LTER), an interdisciplinary program based at the University of California, Santa Barbara Marine Science Institute. SB LTER has been collecting data on size, abundance, and fishing pressure of California Spiny Lobster at five study sites along the Santa Barbara Channel since 2012. Two of the sites, Naples and Isla Vista, are within Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and three of the sites, Arroyo Quemado, Mohawk, and Carpinteria, are otuside of MPAs (Reed D. 2019). In an effort to investigate lobster size differences or similarities between the study sites within an MPA and those outside of an MPA, this report will analyze lobster sizes between the years of 2012 and 2018 and across the five different study sites.

### DATA AND METHODS

Data for Spiny Lobster abundance and location from 2012 - 2018 were collected and provided by the *(Credit: [LTER Network Data Portal](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?scope=knb-lter-sbc&identifier=77&revision=newest))*. Data on Spiny Lobster size and abundance (individuals) is collected annually by divers in the late summer before the start of the fishing season at five SBC LTER long term kelp forest study sites with two sites within Marine Protected Area’s (MPA): Naples and Isla Vista, and three outside: Arroyo Quemado, Mohawk, and Carpinteria. The variables of interest and analyzed for the report were lobster abundance for each year, lobster size in millimeters, site locations categorized within or outside MPA’s, called MPA’s and non-MPAs, respectively. Mean lobster size distributions (mm) was compared for year 2012 vs 2018 and for site location, MPA vs non-MPA by two-sample, two-sided t-tests (α = 0.05 throughout) as well as applying cohen’s d index to evaluate effect size between groups. All analyses and figures were prepared using R Software Version 1.2.1335.

Spiny Lobster abundance data were compared annually, starting in 2012 - 2018, across each of the five sites (Figure 1). Spiny Lobster abundance at sites, Isla Vista and Naples, within the MPA show an increase in Spiny Lobster abundance collected over time. This increase can be an indicator of MPA’s significant purpose in preserving Spiny Lobster populations since these predators play an important role in maintaining ecological processes of kelp forests. Spiny Lobster counts collected within sites outside MPA’s are consistently low, with the exception of Carpinteria in 2017 (where total counts = 705) but then dropped significantly in 2018. This lack of protection for these sites can be an indicator that there is a lot of influence by human activity for these non-MPA sites.


#### B. Lobster size distribution shifts in 2012 and 2018.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
lobster_size <- lobster_tidy %>% 
  select(year, site, size_mm) %>% 
  filter(year %in% c(2012, 2018)) %>% 
  mutate(year = as.character(year))
  

lobster_size$site[lobster_size$site == "AQUE"] <- "Arroyo Quemado"

lobster_size$site[lobster_size$site == "CARP"] <- "Carpinteria"

lobster_size$site[lobster_size$site == "IVEE"] <- "Isla Vista"

lobster_size$site[lobster_size$site == "MOHK"] <- "Mohawk"

lobster_size$site[lobster_size$site == "NAPL"] <- "Naples"
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = lobster_size) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = size_mm, fill = site, alpha = 0.9, color = site),
                 binwidth = 8,
                 show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_grid(year~site, scales = "free") +
  theme_dark() +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
  labs(x = "Lobster Size (mm)",
       y = "Total Lobster Observations")
```

***Figure 5: Lobster Size Distributions Across 5 Study Sites***
*Lobster size distribution of observations across the MPA Sites: Isla Vista & Naples; and non-MPA Sites: Arroyo Quemado, Carpinteria, Mohawk for the years 2012 and 2018. Data: [Reed D. 2019.](
https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/a593a675d644fdefb736750b291579a0)*

Spiny Lobster counts collected are significantly higher for 2018 (n_MPA2018 = 1244, n_nonMPA = 561,  than in 2012 (n_MPA = 32, n_nonMPA = 199), but that does not matter since a minimum sample of 30 is sufficient enough to compare across these groups. The proportion of size distribution shifts of Spiny Lobsters for sites within MPA’s saw a comeback in larger lobster populations from 2012 to 2018, while sites outside MPA’s saw a decrease in larger lobster populations from 2012 to 2018. Smaller lobsters within MPA sites also experienced a population increase as well.  

Although Mohawk is a site outside of an MPA site, Mohawk has a fairly symmetrical distribution of lobster size for 2012 and 2018. Mohawk may have unique physical features where human activity is not impacting the Mohawk population as drammatically compared to the other sites outside MPA's. 


#### C. Compare mean lobster sizes at MPA vs. non-MPA sites in 2012 and 2018. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
lobster_mean_size <- lobster_tidy %>% 
  mutate(mpa = case_when(
    site %in% c("IVEE", "NAPL") ~ "MPA",
    site %in% c("AQUE", "MOHK", "CARP") ~ "non-MPA")) %>% 
  filter(year %in% c(2012, 2018)) %>% 
  select(year, site, size_mm, mpa) %>% 
  group_by(year, mpa)
```


```{r, echo = FALSE, message= FALSE}
lobster_size_table <- lobster_mean_size %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd = sd(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE),
            sample_size = n()) %>% 
  mutate_if(is.numeric, round, 1)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
lobster_size_table %>% 
  kable(col.names = c("Year",
                      "MPA",
                      "Mean (mm)",
                      "Standard Deviation",
                      "Sample Size")) %>% 
          kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped",
                        full_width = F,
                        position = "center") %>% 
          row_spec(c(1,3),
                   color = "red") %>% 
  row_spec(c(2,4),
                   color = "black")
```

In 2012, lobster samples collected for MPA and non-MPA sites were far smaller than the lobster samples collected in 2018. 

For non-MPA sites, lobster sizes decreased from 2012 to 2018 and for MPA sites, average lobster sizes increased overtime.

The small sample sizes for 2012 may be a factor in why the average sizes for the sites are smaller.


*Null Hypothesis*: The mean size, in millimeters, of lobsters collected at MPA sites vs non-MPA sites are the same.

*Alternate Hypothesis*: The mean size, in millimeters, of lobsters collected at MPA sites vs non-MPA sites are not the same.

##### Lobster size differences between MPA and non-MPA sites for 2012 only


##### Lobster size differences between MPA and non-MPA sites for 2018 only



##### Mean size differences in 2012 and 2018 for MPA Sites only
The mean size of lobsters found within the MPA sites increased by 10.2 millimeters (mm) (from `r round(mean_mpa_2012, 1)`mm to `r round(mean_mpa_2018, 1)`mm) between 2012 and 2018. Between the two years, the size increase is statistically significant (two-sided t-test, t(`r round(size_mpa_ttest$parameter, 1)`) = `r round(size_mpa_ttest$statistic, 1)`, *p* = `r round(size_mpa_ttest$p.value, 1)`) and the effect size is large (Cohen's d = `r round(size_mpa_d$estimate, 2)`). This indicates that from 2012 to 2018, the mean lobster size increase at MPA sites of 10.2mm was significant and substantive.


##### Mean size differences in 2012 and 2018 for non-MPA sites only
Mean sizes of lobsters found within the three non-MPA sites decreased by 1.3mm (from `r round(mean_nonmpa_2012, 1)` mm to `r round(mean_nonmpa_2018, 1)`mm) between 2012 and 2018. Between the two years, the size increase is not statistically significant (two-sided t-test, t(`r round(size_nonmpa_ttest$parameter, 1)`) = `r round(size_nonmpa_ttest$statistic, 1)`, *p* = `r round(size_nonmpa_ttest$p.value)`) and the effect size is small (Cohen's d = `r round(size_nonmpa_d$estimate, 2)`) This indicates that from 2012 to 2018, the mean lobster size decrease at non-MPA sites of 1.3mm was not significant nor substantive.


<br>

### SUMMARY

- Lobster populations within MPA sites show a steady increase overtime while lobster populations outside MPA sites are consistently at low levels (Figure 4).
- The difference of mean sizes of lobsters within MPA sites between 2012 and 2018 was significant and substantive.
- The difference in magnitudes of lobster size between MPA sites and non-MPA sites for 2012 and 2018 is noticeable upon further review of both groups.
