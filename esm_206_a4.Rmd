Results B. Visually explore lobster size distribution shifts by comparing lobster sizes in 2012 and 2018.

```{r}
lobster_size <- lobster_tidy %>% 
  filter(year %in% c(2012, 2018)) %>% 
  select(year, site, size_mm)

lobster_size$site[lobster_size$site == "AQUE"] <- "Arroyo Quemado"

lobster_size$site[lobster_size$site == "CARP"] <- "Carpinteria"

lobster_size$site[lobster_size$site == "IVEE"] <- "Isla Vista"

lobster_size$site[lobster_size$site == "MOHK"] <- "Mohawk"

lobster_size$site[lobster_size$site == "NAPL"] <- "Naples"
```

Results C. Compare mean lobster sizes at MPA vs. non-MPA sites in 2012 and 2018. 

```{r}
lobster_mean_size <- lobster_tidy %>% 
  mutate(mpa = case_when(
    site %in% c("IVEE", "NAPL") ~ "MPA",
    site %in% c("AQUE", "MOHK", "CARP") ~ "Non-MPA")) %>% 
  filter(year %in% c(2012, 2018)) %>% 
  select(year, site, size_mm, mpa) %>% 
  group_by(year, mpa)
```

```{r}
lobster_size_table <- lobster_mean_size %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd = sd(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE),
            sample_size = n()) %>% 
  mutate_if(is.numeric, round, 1)

lobster_size_table %>% 
  kable(col.names = c("Year",
                      "MPA",

                      "Standard Deviation",
                      "Sample Size")) %>%

                        position = "center") %>%
          add_header_above(c("Lobster Size Metrics" = 5))
```


```{r}
size_2012_ttest <- t.test(mpa_2012$size_mm, nonmpa_2012$size_mm, paired = FALSE)
# If P value is lower than alpha (0.5), which it is, we reject the null hypothesis and confirm the alternative hypothesis as it indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis.
size_2012_d <- effsize::cohen.d(mpa_2012$size_mm, nonmpa_2012$size_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
# Effect size is 0.61, which is a medium effect size, thus the difference can be noticed with some effort.

size_2018_ttest <- t.test(mpa_2018$size_mm, nonmpa_2018$size_mm, paired = FALSE)
# If P value is lower than alpha (0.5), which it is, we reject the null hypothesis and confirm the alternative hypothesis as it indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis.
size_2018_d <- effsize::cohen.d(mpa_2018$size_mm, nonmpa_2018$size_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
# Effect size is 0.35, which is a small effect size, thus to notice the difference it would have to be studied.

size_mpa_ttest <- t.test(mpa_2012$size_mm, mpa_2018$size_mm, paired = FALSE)
# If P value is lower than alpha (0.5), which it is, we reject the null hypothesis and confirm the alternative hypothesis as it indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis.
size_mpa_d <- effsize::cohen.d(mpa_2012$size_mm, mpa_2018$size_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
# Effect size is 0.87, which is a large effect size, thus the difference is easily noticeable. Cohen's D shows that the P value's rejection of the null hypothesis is easily noticeable.

size_nonmpa_ttest <- t.test(nonmpa_2012$size_mm, nonmpa_2018$size_mm, paired = FALSE)
# If P value is lower than alpha (0.5), which it is NOT, thus we fail to reject the null hypothesis as it indicates weak evidence against the null hypothesis.
size_nonmpa_d <- effsize::cohen.d(nonmpa_2012$size_mm, nonmpa_2018$size_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
# Effect size is 0.12, which is a small effect size, thus the difference between the samples is not easily noticeable. Cohen's D confirms that the uncertainty in the rejection of the null hypothesis, as indicated by the P value, is small.
```

*Null Hypothesis*: The mean size, in millimeters, of lobsters collected at MPA sites vs non-MPA sites are the same.

*Alternate Hypothesis*: The mean size, in millimeters, of lobsters collected at MPA sites vs non-MPA sites are not the same.
